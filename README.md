Our project idea is about rental powder bank since there is a huge potential demand in the real world. Everyone uses a smartphone nowadays. As some researches showed, over the past few years, a rapid increase in the demand of the smartphone has been witnessed, The total number of smartphone user across the globe was estimated to be 2.1 billion in 2016, up from 1.5 billion in 2014, and the number is further estimated to reach 3 billion by the year 2020. And as people know, the main disadvantage of the smartphone is the battery, so we plane to create a power bank people can use anytime and anywhere, it will be such a nice idea. Our jobs (CMPE Student) are to do coding of how power bank box works and our EEEN student will create a machine box to charge it and make a specific powder bank. And people will not bother anymore about power bank in daily life.
Our project is consist of three technology, which are hardware development technology, embedded system, software system.
Physically, the power bank needs to connect to the Internet which can be in many ways: Bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee or wired rj45. From the perspective of its application scenario, electricity is not a problem, it should be WiFi or Bluetooth. Our project core function is to charge, then there should be battery control technology (its battery), charge protection (its charge), discharge protection (charge your mobile phone and adjust the temperature of the tool). The power bank is charged by the machine box called PBS(power bank station ) which stores the power bank,  and the PBS is the important part of the layout because it is the transfer station between power and customers, it not only charge and mange and power bank, also it provides the function that customer rent and return the devices by QR code we create. The users scan the QR code to access the application and capture to expend payment and rent the power bank. So the box station must be smart and intelligent associated with the hardware  MCU to achieve the foundation of its charging time to determine the payment amount of this functionality. The station has a communication protocol with the application. As long as the users start to click rent the power bank, the server will send a security code（for example)  to station, donates the charger 01 mouth unlock the mouth. After receiving this command, the box station opens mouth 01 charging. 
Therefore, the general process is as follows: user scan code and  ready to  rent --> the server-side identifies the target charger and port, sends the instruction --> the charger receives the instruction to unlock the mouth  --> start counting the time customer would have rent --> customer return the power bank in the empty mouth --> the station box calculates the time  has been assumed --> lock the mouth --> 

The schedule of our project is finishing the proposal project and complete the sketch and requirements before the end of October.
